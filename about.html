          <h1>About Me</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm <strong>Andile Mabida</strong>, a 19-year-old frontend developer and UX designer based in Amanzimtoti,
          KwaZulu-Natal. I’m passionate about crafting beautiful, intuitive digital experiences that not only look
          good—but also feel good to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by the intersection of design and technology. What began as curiosity
          soon evolved into a purpose: creating visually striking interfaces that solve real-world problems. Whether I’m
          fine-tuning a layout or optimizing a user flow, I approach every project with focus, creativity, and a drive
          for excellence.
        </p>
        <h3>Where I’m From</h3>
        <p>
          I proudly call Amanzimtoti my home—a coastal town that has taught me the value of simplicity, clarity, and
          resilience. Growing up here, I developed an eye for detail and a mindset that embraces growth and learning.
        </p>
        <h3>What Drives Me</h3>
        <p>
          I believe in continuous learning and staying ahead in a fast-paced digital world. From mastering the latest
          CSS techniques to studying UX psychology, I'm always pushing myself to deliver better, cleaner, smarter work.
          I don't just build interfaces—I craft experiences that leave a lasting impression.
        </p>
        <h3>Beyond the Code</h3>
        <p>
          Outside of development, I have a keen interest in photography, which further sharpens my sense of composition
          and storytelling. I also love teaching and sharing knowledge—empowering others to discover their own creative
          potential.
